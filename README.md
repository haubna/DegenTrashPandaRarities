# Degen Trash Panda - Rarities

The rarity calculator calculates the actual percentage of each trait (and non-existing ones) and multiplies the percentages of them. This doesn't include the traits of exiled trash pandas or special conditions like the 10% that the background doesn't match the fur color.

**rarities.txt** > contains the rarities calculated by RarityCalculator.java

**trash_pandas.txt** > contains the metadata of all 20,000 trash pandas

**RarityCalculator.java** > rarity calculator used for rarities.txt so you can have a look at it
